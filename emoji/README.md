# Emojis

Most of the existing Emoji libraries are released under somewhat restrictive
licenses. [OpenMoji](https://www.openmoji.org/about/) is a great open-source
alternative, released under the lengthy but bearable Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0
International. However, nearly all of their emojis have a black border which
severely hinders their use within a dark theme user interface.

I started making some emoji's from scratch because I wanted simple, totally
free emojis that can be used in both light and dark themes.
